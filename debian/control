Description: lightweight convenience library to handle low level BSD sockets in C++ - libs
 Socket++ library defines a family of C++ classes that can be used more
 effectively than directly calling the underlying low-level system functions.
 One distinct advantage of the socket++ is that it has the same interface as
 that of the iostream so that the users can perform type-safe input output.
 See your local IOStream library documentation for more information on
 iostreams.
 .
 This package contains the libraries needed to run socket++ applications.
